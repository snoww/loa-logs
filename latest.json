If you see any of us in town or raid, consider dropping an honor! \n- Snowving on Luterra\n- Administrator on Ratik\n- Poont on Gienah\n\n#### NEW FEATURES\n- RDPS\n  - pseudo rdps based off of in-game Combat Analyzer (thanks to research by molen and poont)\n  - for DPS classes: \n    - **uDMG, uDPS (unbuffed)**: shows damage and dps without SUPPORT buffs (AP, Brand, Identity, and T). This is what the in-game combat analyzer uses to calculate rdps for supports\n  - for support classes: \n    - **bDMG, bDPS (buffed)**: the amount of  damage that the skill buffed. \n    - **bD%**: shows the amount of damage the support contributed relative to the entire raid (in support's breakdown). \n    - **DR**: shows the damage mitigated by the skill\n  - column visibility can be adjusted in settings, for logs and meter\n- Future statistics and percentiles will be based off pseudo rdps once enough data has been collected. Please upload all your logs after you update!\n\n#### BUG FIXES AND IMPROVEMENTS\n- fixed adrenaline crit rate buff missing\n- fixed players missing in encounter preview\n\n![udps](https://i.imgur.com/PpP8PlK.png)\n\n![udps breakdown](https://i.imgur.com/bdlweJ5.png)\n\n![bdps](https://i.imgur.com/IT2R9yl.png)\n",
